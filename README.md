lab3 -README

A.
How To Compile :
	Use the command "make", and enter ./lab3, then will print the total weight of top 5 cows.

B.
	As the picture shows, the cost times of sort() with size are 1000, 10000, 100000 and 1000000 are 0.000137sec, 0.001862sec, 0.023721sec, 0.282633sec. 
	They are obeying  O(n*log(n)).Similarly, use the insertion_sort(),the cost times are obeying O(n^2).
	As the size becomes larger, the cost time of insertion_sort() will dramatically rise.
